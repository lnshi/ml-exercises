    "\n",
    "- In statistics, the logistic model (or logit model) is a widely used statistical model that, in its basic form, uses a [logistic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function) to model a binary dependent variable; many more complex [extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression#Extensions) exist;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In regression analysis, logistic regression (or logit regression) is estimating the parameters of a logistic model; it is a form of binomial regression. Mathematically, a binary logistic model has a dependent variable with two possible values, such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick; these are represented by an indicator variable, where the two values are labeled \"0\" and \"1\";\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the logistic model, the [log-odds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-odds) (the logarithm of the odds) for the value labeled \"1\" is a linear combination of one or more independent variables (\"predictors\"); the independent variables can each be a binary variable (two classes, coded by an indicator variable) or a continuous variable (any real value). The corresponding probability of the value labeled \"1\" can vary between 0 (certainly the value \"0\") and 1 (certainly the value \"1\"), hence the labeling; the function that converts log-odds to probability is the logistic function, hence the name;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The [unit of measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_measurement) for the log-odds scale is called a [logit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logit), from **log**istic un**it**, hence the alternative names;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analogous models with a different sigmoid function instead of the logistic function can also be used, such as the [probit model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probit_model); the defining characteristic of the logistic model is that increasing one of the independent variables multiplicatively scales the odds of the given outcome at a constant rate, with each dependent variable having its own parameter; for a binary independent variable this generalizes the [odds ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio);\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logistic regression was developed by statistician David Cox in 1958. The binary logistic regression model has [extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression#Extensions) to more than two levels of the dependent variable: categorical outputs with more than two values are modelled by [multinomial logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logistic_regression), and if the multiple categories are [ordered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement#Ordinal_type), by [ordinal logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_logistic_regression), for example the proportional odds ordinal logistic model. The model itself simply models probability of output in terms of input, and does not perform [statistical classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification) (it is not a classifier), though it can be used to make a classifier, for instance by choosing a cutoff value and classifying inputs with probability greater than the cutoff as one class, below the cutoff as the other; this is a common way to make a binary classifier. The coefficients are generally not computed by a closed-form expression, unlike [linear least squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_least_squares_(mathematics)); see [§ Model fitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression#Model_fitting);\n",
