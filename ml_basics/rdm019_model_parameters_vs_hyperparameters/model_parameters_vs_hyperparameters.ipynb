    "In machine learning, we use the term __hyperparameters__ to distinguish from standard model parameters;\n",
    "\n",
    "A machine learning model is the definition of a mathematical formula with a number of parameters that need to be __learned__ from the data. That is the crux of machine learning: fitting a model to the data, this is done via the __training__;\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is another kind of parameters that cannot be directly learned from the regular training process. These parameters express __higher-level properties__ of the model such as its complexity or __how fast__ it should learn. They are called hyperparameters;\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameters are usually fixed before the actual training process begins;\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding how the hyperparameters are decided, generally speaking: it is done by setting different values for those hyperparameters, training different models, and then decide which ones work best by testing them;\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, hyperparameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define higher level properties about the model such as complexity, learning rate;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cannot be learned directly from the data in the training, need to be predefined;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can be decided by setting different values, training different models, and choosing the values that works better;\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of hyperparameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of leaves or depth of a tree\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of latent factors in a matrix factorization\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learning rate\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of hidden layers in a deep neural network\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of clusters in a k-means clustering\n",
